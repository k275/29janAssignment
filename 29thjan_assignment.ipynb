    "Python is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose dynamic programming language that focuses on code readability. It generally has small programs when compared to Java and C. It was founded in 1991 by developer Guido Van Rossum. Python ranks among the most popular and fastest-growing languages in the world. Python is a powerful, flexible, and easy-to-use language. In addition, the python community is very active. It is used in many organizations as it supports multiple programming paradigms. It also performs automatic memory management.\n",
